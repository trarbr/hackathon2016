##How might we help people living in Odense?
We find a problem and solve it.

##Area
Recycling

##Problem of people of Odense
Often missing the date when the bins are emptied,
difficulties with finding correct bin for the particular garbage,
not enough knowledge about recycling various materials.

##Our solution
Developing a platform where it is easy to find the closest bin of any kind,
where the poeple can sign up for a reminder when the particular bin is going to be emptied, so they would not forget to take it out;
where all the information about the garbage is provided, which bin to use for what material.

##Outcome for people
Life made easy;
easier and more convenient wat of getting rid of the trash,
throwing out old clothes made more pleasant by knowing it goes for the charity.

##Outcome for Odense Kommune
The recycling rate will increase,
the city will become even more environment friendly,
charities will get more goods, because there are more people using the 'clothes' bins.
